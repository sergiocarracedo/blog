Hello! I'm Sergio Carracedo, a software engineer with a passion for building innovative solutions and sharing knowledge through my blog. I love exploring new technologies and writing about my experiences.

## A swallow sight into my journey as software engineer

When a wonderful CPC464 with a green phosphor monitor fell into my hands, I immediately understood that everything related to computers and computing was what I had been searching for over the years.

I lived in a time when computing was just beginning to emerge and become popular, which allowed me to get to know it from its foundations and thus be able to understand any new technology. Over these years I have maintained my appetite for knowledge.

I started programming in BASIC and QBASIC. Later, I discovered TurboPascal (something much more structured and serious), and after learning multiple languages and frameworks such as PHP, Javascript, Typescript, Golang, Vue, React, Angular, etc., I realized they were nothing more than tools to solve problems and express my creativity.


## My professional background

With over two decades of hands-on expertise in the dynamic realm of web development, I am recognized as a seasoned senior fullstack developer. I love to work in diverse and collaborative team, where my passion for crafting innovative solutions and contributing to impactful projects truly shines.

### Frontend Expertise:
Specializing in the creation of robust UI components libraries and dynamic data visualization, I am well-versed in shaping frontend architectures. My proficiency extends to working with technologies such as React, Vue.js, Typescript, and Angular. Notably, I am the proud creator of SirenoGrid, an open-source CSS Grid Layout framework.

### Backend Mastery:
My extensive background encompasses working with various languages and frameworks, including Go, PHP, Symfony, Laravel, Drupal, Typesctipt (Node.js). I consistently adhere to the principles of clean code and industry best practices, ensuring the development of scalable applications. Additionally, my expertise extends to configuring and optimizing infrastructure components such as nginx, Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible, Apache, and GitHub Actions.

### Speaker and Community Engagement:
With a passion for knowledge-sharing, I have delivered over 10 talks and contributed as a former co-organizer of PHPVigo and PulpoCon. As a member of the VigoTech Alliance, I actively participate in fostering a collaborative tech community.

### Product and Impact-Driven Mindset:
I am enthusiastic about contributing to product and problem-solving-oriented teams. Believing that every role plays a crucial part in the larger organizational "machine," I am committed to creating tangible impact within the company.
