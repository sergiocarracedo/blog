Today I want to share a small tip working with CORS and Axios.

It's very typical in the backend to only allow certain headers, even more so when it defines the CORS-related `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header used in response to a preflight request. In those cases, if the frontend
make a request with an _unexpected_ header the request will be rejected.

This kind of issue mostly happens in the production environments because the browser ignores CORS headers when it
fetches data from `localhost`. That is a problem as nobody will probably detect an issue sending unexpected headers
before deploying the code to production.

## Axios interceptors

[Axios](https://axios-http.com/) is a widely used library to manage HTTP requests that have an interesting feature: **the
interceptors** are like middlewares where you can execute code before the request (_request interceptors_) and/or
after getting the response (_response interceptors_)

We will focus on the request interceptors, which are executed before the request to the server is made, this is
the perfect place to put our code:

```ts
import type { InternalAxiosRequestConfig } from 'axios'

const allowedCorsHeaders = ['Authorization','Origin','X-Requested-With', 'Content-Type','Accept'].map((header) =>
header.toLowerCase())

function validateHeadersInterceptor(config: InternalAxiosRequestConfig): InternalAxiosRequestConfig => {
  // Get the headers we are sending in the requests
  const headers = Object.keys(config.headers).map((header) => header.toLowerCase())
  // Get the headers to send are not in the allowed list
  const invalidHeaders = headers.filter((header) => !allowedCorsHeaders.includes(header))

  if (invalidHeaders.length > 0) {
    const msg = `Header(s): ${invalidHeaders.join(', ')} are not allowed.`
    throw new Error(msg)
  }
  return config
}
```

The `validateHeadersInterceptor` function gets the `config` (the current request config) and checks if there are some unexpected headers, if there are thrown an error let the developer know she/he is using an unexpected header.

Using the interceptor is easier as do the:

```ts
axios.interceptors.request.use(validateHeadersInterceptor);
```

## The interceptor's order

You should know that when you have multiple interceptors, the execution order is the inverse of the "use" order

For example:

```ts
axios.interceptors.request.use(interceptor1);
axios.interceptors.request.use(interceptor2);
axios.interceptors.request.use(validateHeadersInterceptor);
axios.interceptors.request.use(interceptor3);
```

the execution order will be `interceptor3`, `validateHeadersInterceptor`, `interceptor2` and `interceptor1`. In our `validateHeadersInterceptor` case we want to check even if another interceptor adds an invalid header. In the example if `interceptor1` or `interceptor2` add a header to the request we will not notice it as the validator was executed before.

We should ensure our interceptor is "used" first, before any other interceptor.
