Typescript is a great "language", makes it possible to create more maintainable and understandable software, but requires extra effort to type the variables, the functions' arguments, etc...

Vue 2.x, and even more Vue 3 provide a great typescript integration, providing the necessary types to use your app, but not always are trivial, and you need to know the types you must use in every case.

I want to share with all of you the lessons I learned in my experience using Vue and TS, the typical questions, and the "problems" I found in the way.

# Vuex

Typing the Vuex's store can't be straightforward, my first time typing the store was frustrating because I didn't know types use.

## State

The state is a JS object, in type you can type it as a generic `Record<string, any>` but this is not nice. It's better creating and interface that define all the store items types, for example, imagine this store:

```js
const store = {
  name: 'Sergio',
  lastLogin: new Date(2021, 0, 1, 22, 34),
  config: {
    darkTheme: true,
    fontSize: 23,
  },
  friends: [
    { id: 1, name: 'Juan' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Felipe' },
  ],
};
```

We must create an interface for this object:

```ts
interface Friend {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}
interface StoreState {
  name: string;
  lastLogin?: Date;
  config: {
    darkTheme: boolean;
    fontSize: number;
  };
  friends: Friend[];
}
const store: StoreState = {
  name: 'Sergio',
  lastLogin: new Date(2021, 0, 1, 22, 34),
  config: {
    darkTheme: true,
    fontSize: 23,
  },
  friends: [
    { id: 1, name: 'Juan' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Felipe' },
  ],
};
```

## Mutations

For the mutations, Vuex provides the type `MutationTree<S>`, defined as:

```ts
interface MutationTree<S> {
  [key: string]: Mutation<S>;
}
type Mutation<S> = (state: S, payload?: any) => any;
```

Basically is a map of mutation functions, as you can see, a mutation function get the state type, but the payload can be anything and return anything

```ts
const mutations: MutationTree<StoreState> = {
  setName(store, payload: string) {
    store.name = payload;
  },
};
```

> As the payload is defined by the type as `any` it's a good practice type your payload in every mutation function

## Actions

It's similar to the mutations, but with a peculiarity:

```ts
interface ActionTree<S, R> {
  [key: string]: Mutation<S, R>;
}
type Action<S, R> = ActionHandler<S, R> | ActionObject<S, R>;
```

Without going deeper, the `S` is the state of the vuex module, and `R` is the **Root State**. In a simple case (without using vuex modules) `S` and `R` are the same.

## Getters

Same as actions,

```ts
interface GetterTree<S, R> {
  [key: string]: Getter<S, R>;
}
```

For example:

```ts
const getters: GetterTree<StoreState, StoreState> = {
  friendCount(store): number {
    return store.friends.length;
  },
};
```

> As in the store payload params, it's a good practice to type getter return

# Composition API

If you are using composition API in the setup function we can type our properties as we did in the store. Make sure you are using `defineComponent` instead `Vue.extend` to make it work

```ts
interface Props {
    value: boolean,
    title: string
}

export default defineComponent({
    name: 'my-component',
    props: {
        value: Boolean,
        title: String
    },
    setup (props: Props) {
     ...
    }
})
```

You can also type the properties directly in the `props` entry, but as **typescript interfaces don't exist at runtime** we can't use the interface directly as the property type

```ts
// Doesn't work because Friend doesn't exists in the runtime
{
  props: {
    friend: {
      type: Friend;
    }
  }
}
// Doesn't work because Object doesn't implement Friend properties
{
  props: {
    friend: {
      type: Object as Friend;
    }
  }
}
```

But, we can pass the type as return of a function, then Vue instance the interface instances the interface and can check the value type

```ts
// Works
{
  props: {
    friend: Object as () => Friend,
    friends: Array as () => Friend[],
    name: String as () => string
  }
}
```

Remember to type "native" types because `String` is not the same as `string` (`String` is an object and string is a type) [More info about this in Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14727461)

# Add extra properties to Vue Component Object

By default, Vue provides us a defined structure for the Vue Component Object, for example, the property `data`, `props`, etc... Using vanilla JS we can add a new property to the Vue Component Object without doing extra works, for example, we want to add a property called `layout` that makes our root component can use different layouts in our view.

```js
export default {
  name: 'my-component',
  layout: '2-cols',
};
```

If we try to do this using typescript we will get an error because the property `layout` wasn't defined in the Vue Component Object. To fix it we must extend the definition creating a definition file in our `src/`, for example, `src/typings.d.ts`

```ts
# src/typings.d.ts
import Vue from 'vue'

declare module 'vue/types/options' {
  interface ComponentOptions<V extends Vue> {
    layout?: string;
  }
}
```

# Add extra properties to the Vue Instance

As in the previous chapter, we could want to add a new property to the Vue Instance, for example, to add a global functionality like a toast, etc: `vm.$toast.open()`

Remember you can do it doing something like this, for example, during the plugin installation:

```js
Vue.prototype.$toast = {
    open: () => {
        ....
    }
} as ToastHandler
```

Then we must add to our _definition_ file these lines to declare the new Vue instance properties and their types

```ts
# src/typings.d.ts
import Vue from 'vue'
declare module 'vue/types/vue' {
  interface Vue {
    $toast: ToastHandler;
  }
}
```

Typescript can be tough at the beginning, but gives you more confidence in your code and make it more readable, for example

```ts
{
    props: {
        friend: Object as () => Friend,
        person: Object
    }
}
```

For example in the case of `friend` you only need to go to the type declarations to know the 'friend`structure and properties, even your IDE can provide you autocomplete, but for`person` is very hard to know the object structure. I hope this post can help you using Typescript and Vue.
