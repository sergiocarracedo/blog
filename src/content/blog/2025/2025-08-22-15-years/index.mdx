On a day like the one I wrote this post, 15 years ago, I wrote first post. I was about :astro-ref[using the page title to show page notifications]{path="blog/2010/usabilidad-notificaciones-en-el-titulo-de-la-pagina"} (Spanish).

I wrote it just as a way to share my knowledge and force myself to learn more about a topic before writing the post.

With today's eyes, that post seems quite naive and simplistic, but it was a starting point of a long journey. I never imagined that this blog would last for so long. 

To give you context, in 2010 the most used browser was Internet Explorer with more than 50%, Firefox was used by the 33% of the users and Chrome was just starting to gain traction. <small>Source: https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide/2010</small>


The smartphones started to gain popularity (3 years before the frist iPhone was launched) and Android was in version 2.2 ([Froyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Froyo)).

Node.js was launched one year before and its popularity was not the one we see today. I wrote a post about my frist contact with it :astro-ref[Node.js: Javascript power!!]{path="blog/2010/nodejs-javascript-power"} (Spanish).

I was programming in PHP (Version 5) and exploring the possibilities of JavaScript on the server side, also using [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), and still uploading the websites using via FTP Filezilla. 

My skills in speaking or writing in English were near zero. 

In general terms, the web development was quite different from today. Handling Internet Explorer 6/7 was a nightmare; each browser had a different implementation of the standards, and the mobile web was in its infancy. Making a rounded corner was a challenging task that usually involved images.

2010 was not the start of my career, I started to program in 1985-86 on an Amstrad CPC 464, and I started working professionally (getting money) as a developer in 2005,

Over these 15 years, a lot has changed; the technical context is very different, but our job is still the same: to solve problems and create value through technology. 

I also changed a lot. I learned new programming languages, frameworks, and tools that have shaped my career. I collaborated with the local community, survived lymphoma, learned English, worked at big companies, met a lot of people, and I am still here, writing in my blog.

I try to imagine myself in 15 years, but is very hard to predict where I will be, but Iá¸¿ pretty sure that I will still being curious, with a strong desire to learn, understand how the things works under the hood and adapt to new challenges.

I only can say thanks to you for reading and being part of this journey.
