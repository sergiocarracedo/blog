**On a day like this, 15 years ago, I wrote my first post**. It was about :astro-ref[using the page title to show page notifications]{path="blog/2010/usabilidad-notificaciones-en-el-titulo-de-la-pagina"} (Spanish).

I wrote it just as a way to share my knowledge and force myself to learn more about a topic before writing the post.

With today's eyes, that post seems quite naive and simplistic, but it was a starting point of a long journey. I never imagined that this blog would last for so long. 

To give you context, in 2010 the most used browser was Internet Explorer with more than 50%, Firefox was used by the 33% of users and Chrome was just starting to gain traction. <small>Source: https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide/2010</small>


Smartphones were starting to gain popularity (3 years before the first iPhone was launched)" and Android was in version 2.2 ([Froyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Froyo)).

Node.js was launched one year before and its popularity was not the one we see today. I wrote a post about my frist contact with it :astro-ref[Node.js: Javascript power!!]{path="blog/2010/nodejs-javascript-power"} (Spanish).

I was programming in PHP (Version 5) and exploring the possibilities of JavaScript on the server side, also using [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), and still uploading the websites using Filezilla. 

My skills in speaking and writing English were close to zero.

In general terms, the web development was quite different from today. Handling Internet Explorer 6/7 was a nightmare; each browser had a different implementation of the standards, and the mobile web was in its infancy. Creating rounded corners was a challenging task that usually required images."

010 was not the start of my career. I began programming in 1985â€“86 on an Amstrad CPC 464, and I started working professionally (getting paid) as a developer in 2005

Over these 15 years, a lot has changed; the technical context is very different, but our job is still the same: to solve problems and create value through technology. 

**I also changed a lot. I learned new programming languages, frameworks, and tools that have shaped my career. I collaborated with the local community, survived lymphoma, learned English, worked at big companies, met a lot of people and made very good friends, and I am still here, writing on my blog.**

**I try to imagine myself in 15 years, but it is very hard to predict where I will be. But I'm pretty sure that I will still be curious, with a strong desire to learn, understand how things work under the hood, and adapt to new challenges.**

I can only say thanks to you for reading and being part of this journey.
