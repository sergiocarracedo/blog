In this post I want to share my experience of working in multiple design system teams, and it will not be a technical post, but more about the goals, pains and successes of a design system team.

## Introduction

A design system is a collection of reusable components, guidelines, paterns and best practices that helps a company to **build consistent** and **efficient user** interfaces. It provides the building blocks to create a cohesive user experience across your product or products and platforms. Multiple disciplines are involved: Design, Frontend engineering, Product management, and more.

A design system team is a group of people who covers the disciplines mentiones and who are responsible for the design system.

**- Is it always necessary to have a design system?** I think so (at least in most cases), a design sytems helps to create consistent user experiences, to speed up the development process, to make the base maintainable.

**- Is it always necessary to have a design system team?** 
No, depending on the size of your company and the complexity of your product, you can use a third-party design system, or the same designers, product managers and engineers can work on the design system at the same time as they work on the product. 

But if you have a complex product, or a large team, then it is worth to have a dedicated design system team to ensure that the design system is well-maintained, up-to-date, and aligned with the product's goals.

A design system is a commodity, but it doesn't mean it is not important:

- It means, it has no value by itself, it needs to be used by the product teams to create value. 

- It doesn't mean you can not put attention or resources on it. In fact, investing in the design system can lead to significant long-term benefits for the entire organization.

As a similarity we can think of electricity: it is a commodity, but it is essential for the functioning of many products and services if the supply is not good it will be hard to create good products or they will be not usable if the supply fails. A design system is like electricity, it is a commodity that provides the foundation for building products and services and needs to be good to create nice product≈õ.
  
## Goals of a design system team

**The main goal of a design system team is freeing up product teams from non-product-related tasks. Letting them focus on building features and solving user problems.**

They should not worry about (or solve common) design tokens, components, patterns, or workflows. Each second they spend on those tasks is a second they are not spending creating a better product.

In any case we can split that goal in smaller goals:

The goals of a dedicated design system team can vary depending on the company and product, but some common goals include:

- **Create the design tokens**: Design tokens are the variables that define the design system's visual style, such as colors, typography, spacing, etc. They should be consistent and reusable across the design system.

- **Create the basic UI components**: Those components are the building blocks of the design system, such as buttons, inputs, modals, etc. They should be reusable and customizable to fit different use cases. They are comodity components, every design system have them, but they should be well-designed and well-implemented to ensure a consistent user experience. Even if they are common, simple and comodity components, there are important decisions to be made in order of the consistence. For example, in a button, we can render icons in the left or right side, or just in the left side.

- **Define the common patterns**: For example, how to render the tabular data, the elements can be rendered in a table, etc

- **Define the workflows**: How the user should create a new element, what are the steps to follow, how to handle errors and show errors, etc.
