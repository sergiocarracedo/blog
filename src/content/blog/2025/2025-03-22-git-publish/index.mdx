Releasing and publishing a JavaScript/TypeScript package to a _npm registry_ is something relatively easy to do.

There are a lot of tutorials and guides on the internet about how to do it, and the process is well documented in the
npm/yarn/pnpm's
documentation.

**But what about releasing and publishing an ephemeral version of a package?** For example when you want to test a
feature, a refactor, or a fix you are working on the package in another project which uses the package, but without
generate a release or publish a new version (even an alpha version) or when want to share those changes with another
a teammate in your company to let them know the changes are coming and give them a chance to test it before doing an
alpha
release.

You can use the same process you use for a regular release, but tag the package as alpha and, if you
are using semver, you can use a [pre-release tag](https://semver.org/#spec-item-9) like `1.0.0-alpha.1`.

But this method has some drawbacks:

- If you automate the release (pre-release) process to create a pre-release when a PR is created or synchronized, you
  will end up with many pre-releases in the registry. Registries like npmjs.com only allow you to unpublish a
  package's version within 72 hours after it was published and if it is not used by another package.
- You need to remember to bump the version when you want to create a new pre-release or automate the process to do it
- If your package is public, pre-releases will be visible to everyone, and you may not want to share them with the
  world.

## Release branches

A release branch is a branch in your repository where you can push the build output of your library. Release branches
are simple to manage, you can create, delete, and update rather than publish in a registry. As another branch, release
branches use the repo access control and permissions, so if your repo is private the release branches will be private.

Our goal is to automate the release branch creation, publishing, and **deleting** process, because as I said before, we
want to remove those branches after the PR is merged or closed (and a stable version is published).

### Using a release branch as a dependency

Before explaining how to automate the release branch creation and publishing, let's how to use a release branch as
dependency.

When you add a dependency to a package, you typically use the latest stable version of the package:
`npm add @myorg/mylib` (which is the same as `npm add @myorg/mylib@latest`), you can also define
a [specific version or a version range](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/configuring-npm/package-json#dependencies). For
example `npm add @myorg/mylib@^1.2.0`.

But you can also use
a [git repo as a dependency](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/configuring-npm/package-json#repository), for example
`npm add git+https://github.com/mmyorg/mylib.git` which will use the default branch (`master` or `main`) of the repo as
source for the dependency.

We can go further and use a specific branch, tag, or commit hash as a dependency, for example:

- `npm add git+ssh://git@github.com:myorg/mylib.git#v1.0.27 (tag)`
- `npm add git+ssh://git@github.com:myorg/mylib.git#my-branch (branch)`
- `npm add git+ssh://git@github.com:myorg/mylib.git#af2334345df45gfdfgdfg (commit hash)`

> For GitHub, GitHub gist, Bitbucket, or GitLab repositories we can use shortcuts to make it even easier
>
> - `npm add github:myorg/mylib`
> - `npm add bitbucket:myorg/mylib`
> - `npm add gitlab:myorg/mylib`
> - `npm add gist:myorg/mylib`

### The package publishing process

Before automating the release branch creation and publishing, let me explain how is the process of publishing a npm's
package:

After building the code, you execute `npm publish`, this CLI tool will check the `package.json` file to get the package
name and to read the `files` property to know which files are part of the package. Then it will create a tarball with
those files and upload it to the registry.

If no `files` property is defined, `npm` will use all the files in the project (except
the ones defined in the `.npmignore` file if exists).

We want to replicate this process but instead of publishing the package to the registry, we will push the files defined
in the `package/json` to a release branch.

### Git publish

[Git publish](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-publish_) is a npm's package (you can use it without adding it as a
dependency: `npx git-publish
`)
That gives you a CLI tool that replicates the `npm publish` process but instead of creating a tarball and publishing it
to the registry, it will push the files to a release branch. Just the files defined in the `package.json` like
`npm publish` does.

## Automating the release branch creation and publishing

To make this useful we should automate all the workflow:

1. Build the code and create the release branch when a PR is created or synchronized (new commits are pushed).
2. Delete the release branch when the PR is merged or closed

You can use a CI/CD tool like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, etc. to automate the process. In this example, I
will use GitHub Actions:

```yaml
#.github/workflows/publish-release-branch.yml
name: 'Build and Publish release branch'

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  publish-alpha:
    name: 'Build and Publish release branch'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - run: |
          RELEASE_BRANCH="npm/release-branch-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}"
          pnpx  -b $RELEASE_BRANCH
          LAST=$(git log -n 1 'origin/$RELEASE_BRANCH' --pretty=format:"%H")
          # Shows a message in github actions to let the user know the package is published and how to install it
          echo "::notice title='Package published'::Use pnpm i github:mycompany/mypackage#$RELEASE_BRANCH to install the package (or pnpm i github:mycompany/mypackage#${LAST} to install this specific commit)"
```

The workflow will be triggered when a PR is created or synchronized, it will build the code and create a release branch
you can use as I mentioned above, and to make it easier the actions include a message with the command to install the
package in other projects.

As we want to delete the release branch when the PR is merged or closed, we need to add another workflow to delete it

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]

jobs:
  clear-release-braanches:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      packages: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - if: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
        run: |
          RELEASE_BRANCH="npm/release-branch-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}"
          git push origin --delete $RELEASE_BRANCH
```

## What if I have a monorepo with multiple packages?

Well this tool is not ready yet to work with monorepos, but as I had this need in a project I am working on, I created
a fork and a [Pull Request](https://github.com/privatenumber/git-publish/pull/10) to include a feature define the
working directory so you can use it in monorepos

This PR is not merged at the moment of writing this article, but you can use my fork release branch, you only need to
replace `pnpx  -b $RELEASE_BRANCH` with

```
pnpx sergiocarracedo/git-publish#npm/feat/directory-support -b "[RELEASE_BRANCH_NAME]" --directory [PACKAGE_DIRECTORY]
```

This will use the `PACKAGE_DIRECTORY` as the working directory to create the release branch, storing the release files
in the release branch root folder.
