When you start to create SPA _(Single page application)_ you must bear in mind that SPA doesn't mean _Single JavaScript file_.

You normally use _Webpack_ to handle your app builds, by default, _Webpack_ create one file for all assets, _even CSS_.

The first step, maybe, is separate styles from _app.js_ in their own CSS files.

To do this, we'll use the _Webpack_ plugin _[MiniCssExtractPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/mini-css-extract-plugin/)_ which we'll configure like this:

```js
// webpack.config.js
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
      filename: '[name].css'
    })
  ],
  ...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,
            options: {
              publicPath: '/public/path/to/',
            },
          },
          'css-loader',
          ... // Other loaders like sass-loader or postcss-loader
        ],
      }
      ...
    ]
  },
```

This forces _Webpack_ to extract CSS into separated files, for example `app.css`

If you use _vue-cli_, this is the default config for _Webpack_.

### Going forward

For simple apps it is a good idea keep all your built code into a single file, because client's browser loads `app.css` the first time user accesses your app and keep it in cache, next access the file will be served from local browser's cache (until cache expire).

But when your application starts to grow the `app.js` will be huge, slowing down the page loading. There will even be parts of the app that are never used, for example "pages" (in this context think pages as Vue page component, not static pages) forbidden for regular users.

In this case a good solution is chunking your `app.js` using [async components](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-dynamic-async.html) for page components. You can split every page into different files which will be loaded when user navigates to route.

This strategy uses the _[Webpack's code splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)_ feature.

In Vue router configuration you just do

```js
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    name: 'home',
    component: () => import('./views/HomeComponent')
  },
  ...
]
```

_Webpack_ now will create a separated file for your page components. But this way the user receives no feedback about the loading process. We could improve the router using a loading component.

An async component must provide a _Promise.resolve_. When you write `() => import('./views/HomeComponent')` implicit you return a _Promise_ that resolves the component. But if you want to use the _[handling loading state](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-dynamic-async.html#Handling-Loading-State)_ you need to return an explicit _Promise_

Like this:

```js
import LoadingComponent from './LoadingComponent'

const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    name: 'home',
    component: lazyLoading(import('./views/HomeComponent'))
  },
  ...
]
function lazyLoadView (AsyncPageComponent) {
  const AsyncHandler = () => ({
    component: AsyncPageComponent,
    loading: LoadingComponent,
    ...
  })

  return Promise.resolve({
    functional: true,
    render: (h, { data, children }) => h(AsyncHandler, data, children)
  })
}
```

As you can see, we use a _Promise.resolve_ that returns component render function.

_data_ and _children_ are necessary to pass props, attributes and events to component [More info](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/render-function.html#Passing-Attributes-and-Events-to-Child-Elements-Components)

With these changes, when the user navigate to `/` firstly, the app shows the _LoadingComponent_ and then, when the component is fully loaded, shows it.
Finally, say that you can group the components in the same _chunk_ using the following notation.

```js
import(/* webpackChunkName: "group-main" */ './HomeComponent.vue');
import(/* webpackChunkName: "group-main" */ './LoginComponent.vue');
import(/* webpackChunkName: "group-admin" */ './AdminPageComponent.vue');
```
