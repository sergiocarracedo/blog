Imagine yourself writting a LinkedIn post, you want to correct it, or improve the styling, or even translate it to another language. 
Now you are coping the text to chatGPT, Gemini, or any other LLM, ask it to do the changes and then you are pasting the improved version back to LinkedIn. This is a common workflow for many of us, but it can be time-consuming and inefficient.


# Product definition

I wanted to solve this problem, and make this workflow more seamless and efficient. 

The simpliest and most natural solutions was to create a browser extension that can be used on any website, and can interact with any text input field. This way, you can simply select the input you want to improve, and ask the assistant to do the changes without leaving the website.

The extension adds a button next to any text input field, and when you click it, pops up a modal with a chat interface where you can interact with the assistant, ask it to correct the style, improve the grammar, translate it to another language, etc. The assistant will then update the field field content acording your instructions.

I also wanted to give users the ability to customize the assistant's behavior and personality depending on the website, for example it is not the same when you want to correct the style in linkedin, than in a more informal website like twitter. Also to provide a assistant more context, for example providing your basic personal data, so the assistant can use it to write more personalized content for you.

To achieve this, I provide the assistant with skills support. Skills are just small text files, that can be used to provide the assistant with specific instructions, for example a skill for linkedin can include instructions to write in a more formal style, and to include some specific information about the user. Those skills are active only in the websites (domains) you want, so you can have a more formal assistant in linkedin, and a more informal one in twitter or provide it with different information depending on the website.

But why just limit it to just one input field? Using the side panel, you can select or deselect which field of the page you want to interact with, and can get the context (you can configure easily the access level) and fill multiple fields at the same time, for example if you are filling a sign up form, using an skill with your personal data, you can fill all the fields of the form at the same time, without having to copy and paste the information multiple times.

# How to use it

:float-image[]{src="./extensions.png" maxWidth="220px" float="right"}

You can install the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sireno-assistant/ppnecnomfnadhbcpacgkfldiapoejogo). Once installed, you will see a new extension button in the extension bar. You can click it to open the side panel, where you can configure the AI provider in the settings tab. This requires an API key from any AI provider you want to use, which have cost, not to much, but if you don't have it, I plan to release an update in the coming weeks with support for Groq (not to be confused with Grok), which offers a free tier that can be used with this extension.

You can also manage your skills in the skills tab, check the fields available in the current page in the fields tab, and finally interact with the assistant in the chat tab.

I recommend you to review the default skills, and update the one with yout basic info: name, job, etc. This will allow the assistant to write more personalized content for you. You can also create new skills for specific websites or use cases.

From this moment all the features I described before are available for you to use in any website, just click the button next to any text input field, or use the side panel chat to start interacting with the assistant.


# Technical details

I decided to use this project to experiment OpenCode as vibecoding tool, so YEs, this is a vibecoding project. This allowed me to iterate very quickly and to build the MVP in a very short time, but I must get my hands dirty, because the llm can not understand all the cases, for example it was challenging set the icon position correctly, or to make the assistant work in iframes, shadowdom, etc. (I will talk about my experience with OpenCode in another post).

This extension was also released as open source in GitHub, so you can check the code and contribute if you want: https://github.com/sergiocarracedo?tab=repositories
