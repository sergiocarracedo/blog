As someone is always looking for the next changenge I don't care about contabilize completed tasks, and it is something useful to look back and see what I achived in the past.

So face this, for me, hard work of remebering what in the past Quarter for my performance review, so I was wandering how to automatize this task and I took the opportunity to experiment with AI tools.

My first idea was focus in a specific solution, get some daily stats (commits, PRs, comments, etc) from GitHub, as for a developer it is something very representative of the work done in a day.

The next step was to use an AI model to generate a summary of the day based on these stats, so I can have a concise and clear description of what I did in a human readable format.

And the last step was to store these summaries in a structured way, I decided to use https://obsidian.md/ as it a great tool for note taking and knowledge management, and it allows me to easily organize and search my work diary.

This this simple idea in mind, I write a definition document with the requirements and the steps to follow, and used GitHub Copilot to create a plan, an execute it.

The result, in 2-3 iterations with the agent, was a simple CLI tool that runs daily, fetch the GitHub stats, generate the summary using an AI model, and store the summary in a repo which contains my Obsidian vault.

I could validate the results and they where amazing, as example this real output for a day:

```
# Work Diary - 2026-01-15

## Summary

Today I primarily focused on improving the developer experience around dialog management within the `factorialco/f0` repository. I created a new `useDialog` hook designed to simplify the process of opening and managing dialogs, reducing the amount of boilerplate code required.

Pull request #3242 introduces this new hook, showcasing a more streamlined approach compared to the previous method. The goal is to provide a smoother and more intuitive way for developers to integrate dialogs into the application. This work aims to improve code maintainability and reduce the potential for errors related to dialog state management.
```

## Going further

I undertood the potencial of this tools, so I rethink the architecture to make it more flexible and extensible. I found that:
- not only GitHub stats are useful, other sources like slack, email, jira, etc.  can be useful
- markdown is something can change in other usecases
- maybe I just want to output the summary to other places like email, slack, etc.

With this in mind I redesigned the architecture to have a plugin based system, that provides functionality a 3 + 1 steps process:

- **Input** (Plugins): Plugins which fetch data from different sources (GitHub, Slack, Email, Jira, etc.), and provide a prompt to the AI model to summarize the data.

- **Ai summarizer** (Core): a core module which takes the data from the input plugins and generate a summary using an AI model

- **Formatter** (Plugin): A plugins put together all the plugins summaries and formats it in different formats (Markdown, HTML, Plain text, etc.)

- **Output** (Plugins): Plugins which get the output of the Formatter and store\, print or send the summary to different destinations.

This way I can easily add new input sources, change the AI model, add new formatters or output destinations without changing the core logic of the application.

### Example workflow

Create a workflow as the same in the first iteration looks like this:

```yaml
ai:
  provider: google
  model: gemini-2.5-flash
  apiKey: env:GOOGLE_API_KEY

inputs:
  - plugin: github
    config:
      token: env:GH_READ_TOKEN
      username: env:GH_USERNAME
  - plugin: email
    config:
      provider: gmail
      host: imap.gmail.com
      port: 993
      secure: true
      user: env:IMAP_USER
      password: env:IMAP_PASSWORD
      mailbox: "[Gmail]/Todos"   # pulls everything
      sentMailbox: "[Gmail]/Enviados"  # typical Gmail sent folder
      maxMessages: 200
      
formatter:
  plugin: markdown

outputs:
  - plugin: console
  - plugin: file
    config:
      path: '~/workdiary-{date}.md'
      mode: merge # Dont be worried if the file exists, just append the new summary or updated the previous one as wrapraps the content with markers  
```
> Note the use of env: to get the API keys and sensitive data from environment variables, so they are not stored in plain text in the workflow file. When the tool runs, it will replace these placeholders with the actual values from the environment variables.

And then run the tool to generate the work diary:

```
$ work-diary --workflow ./workflow.yaml
```
## Show me the code!

I thougth this tool can be useful for other people, so relesed it as open source: https://github.com/sergiocarracedo/work-diary, if you want to run it in your machine you can follow the instructions in [SETUP.md](https://github.com/sergiocarracedo/work-diary/blob/main/SETUP.md).

> The project is still in early stages, but if you want to contribute with new plugins, features, etc. you are welcome!

## Running it as a scheduled task

To be valuable, this tool needs to run daily and there are many ways to do it, but I decided to use GitHub Actions as it is easy to setup and maintain, so the repository contains a GitHub Action (sergiocarracedo/work-diary@v1.1.0) you can use in your own repo to run the tool daily.

This is the workflow I use in my repo to run the tool every day at the end of the day and commit the changes to the obsidian repo:

```yaml
# ,.github/workflows/work-diary.yml
name: Work Diary

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "30 23 * * *"
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      date:
        description: "Target date (YYYY-MM-DD, UTC). Defaults to today."
        required: false
        type: string

jobs:
  diary:
    permissions:
      contents: write
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Work Diary
        uses: sergiocarracedo/work-diary@v1.1.0
        env:
          AI_PROVIDER: 'google'
          AI_MODEL: 'gemini-2.5-flash'
          AI_APIKEY: ${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }}
          GH_READ_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_READ_TOKEN }}
          GH_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.GH_USERNAME }}
        with:
          config: |
            ai:
              provider: env:AI_PROVIDER
              model: env:AI_MODEL
              apiKey: env:AI_APIKEY

            inputs:
              - plugin: github
                config:
                  token: env:GH_READ_TOKEN
                  username: env:GH_USERNAME

            formatter:
              plugin: markdown

            outputs:
              - plugin: console
              - plugin: file
                config:
                  path: "Daily Notes/{date}.md"
                  mode: merge

      - name: Commit and push diary changes
        env:
          GIT_AUTHOR_NAME: github-actions[bot]
          GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL: github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com
          GIT_COMMITTER_NAME: github-actions[bot]
          GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL: github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com
        run: |
          git status --porcelain
          if git status --porcelain | grep .; then
            git config user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
            git config user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
            git add .
            git commit -m "chore: update work diary"
            git push
          else
            echo "No changes to commit."
          fi
```

This workflow runs every day at 23:30 UTC, you can adjust the cron expression to fit your needs. It checks out the repository, runs the work-diary tool with the specified configuration, and then commits and pushes any changes to the repository.

## Conclusion
Automatizing my work diary with AI has been a great experience, it has saved me time and effort, and allowed me to focus on more important tasks and gives me a better overview of my work, and I pretty sure it will help me a lot in the future when I need to prepare my performance reviews. :whink::whink:

## Disclaimer
No AI models were harmed during the making of this tool, well I streessed they a little bit :D
