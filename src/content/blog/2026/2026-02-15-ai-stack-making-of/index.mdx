I was experimenting with AI usages and I thought: Why not use Gemini Deep research to write a blog post about the AI engineering stack for junior/mid engineers using it? 

This is the making of that experiment, where I will explain you all the steps and share the prompts I used to create the post. (I will share then with the typos and syntactical errors, to be more transparent about the process).

## First step: Ask Gemini 

I asked Gemini to write the prompt I should use with Gemini Deep Research feature.

```markdown
I want to create a full AI generated post for my blog.
The topic is an explanation (not too much thecnical, for a junior or mid software developer) about the different layers in software development with AI: LLM, agent, CLI or IDE, tools, mcps, skill.md, agents.md, orchestrators like https://www.vibekanban.com/, etc. The goal is allow the audience to understand what is the use case or what is each tool used for.
The outcome should be a markdown file, an user could read in a max of 12m, 
I need a prompt for gemini Deep Research to investigate and create this post

a secondary goal is to create another post explaining the steps I or you followed  to create the post, from this prompt i am writing , passing by the deep research prompt you will generate and the steps it followed to gather the information necessary to write the post.

Before start, ask me anything can improve the outcome
```

The LLMs did a summary and asked me some questions to clarify as I asked in the previous  prompt's last line. 

```markdown
This is a fantastic topic. The AI-for-developers landscape is evolving so fast that terms like "MCP," "Agent," and "Orchestrator" are often used interchangeably, confusing many junior and mid-level developers. A clear, layered explanation will be very high-value.

To make sure the Deep Research prompt I generate for you hits exactly the right notes (and to ensure the secondary "meta-post" is accurate), I have a few clarifying questions:

1. The "Layers" Hierarchy
You mentioned several concepts (LLM, Agent, CLI/IDE, Tools, MCPs, skill.md, Orchestrator). To structure the research correctly, how do you visualize the relationship?

Option A (The Stack): LLM is the bottom (Foundation), Agents sit on top, Tools are what Agents use, and the IDE is the interface where the human sits.

Option B (The Workflow): Grouped by phase of work (e.g., "Planning" vs. "Coding" vs. "Testing").

My assumption: Option A is usually clearer for this audience. Is that your preference?

2. Specific Technologies & Examples
You mentioned vibekanban.com (which appears to be a newer or niche visual orchestrator), skill.md, and agents.md.

Context: Are skill.md and agents.md references to specific standards (like the ones used in Cline/Roo Code or similar agentic tools), or are you referring to general documentation practices?

Standard Tools: Should the research explicitly include widely known tools to anchor the reader? (e.g., Anthropic's MCP, Cursor, Windsurf, LangChain, or Cline)?

VibeKanban: Is this post specifically to highlight VibeKanban (e.g., a spotlight or sponsored context), or is it just one example among many orchestrators?

3. The Tone and "Takeaway"
Tone: "Not too technical" can mean "explain it like I'm 5" or "explain it like I'm a smart developer who just hasn't used AI agents yet." I assume the latter?

Actionable Advice: Do you want the post to just explain the terms, or do you want to recommend a specific "Getting Started" stack? (e.g., "Start with Cursor, then try building an Agent").

4. The Meta-Post (Secondary Goal)
For the second post about how we built this:

Do you want the "Deep Research" prompt to explicitly include instructions to log its own process for this purpose? (i.e., "As you research, keep a diary of what search terms failed and which succeeded").

Once you answer these, I will craft a comprehensive Deep Research Prompt that you can copy-paste, designed to yield a perfectly structured blog post.
```

I give it the extra context

```markdown
1. Both but not mixed
2. Skill is https://agentskills.io/home and agent.md is https://agents.md/. research widely known tools. Not about vibekanvan specifically, about the workspaces and agent orchestrator
3. the audicence are junior / mid who know a little bit about AI and used copilot or similar tools
4. yes


I forgot to mention i want you to explain the modes: ask, agent, plan, debug, etc
```


It return an explanation and the final prompt to use with Gemini Deep Research in markdown. 

```markdown
This is a perfect structure. By distinguishing between the Stack (the technical layers) and the Workflow (the functional modes), we can give junior/mid developers a mental model that actually makes sense of the chaos.

Here is the Deep Research Prompt optimized for Gemini. You can copy and paste this directly.

1. The Deep Research Prompt
Copy and paste this into Gemini:
```

```
I need you to research and write a comprehensive, educational blog post (approx. 12-minute read) targeting junior-to-mid-level software developers. The goal is to demystify the "AI Engineering Stack" by breaking it down into clear layers and explaining the specific purpose of each tool or standard.

**Critical Instruction for Meta-Analysis:**
As you perform this research, strictly log your process. I need a record of:
1. The specific search queries you used.
2. Which concepts were initially ambiguous and how you clarified them.
3. How you structured the information (e.g., did you change the outline based on findings?).
*I will ask for this "Search Journey" log after the blog post is written.*

### The Blog Post Requirements:

**Title Idea:** "From Chatbot to Coworker: Understanding the AI Dev Layers" (or similar)

**Tone:**
* Clear, "senior engineer mentor" vibe.
* Not too academic, but technically accurate.
* Avoid hype; focus on utility.

**Structure & Key Concepts to Cover:**

**Part 1: The Stack (The "What")**
Explain the hierarchy using a "Brain -> Hands -> Worker -> Manager" analogy or similar:
1.  **The Foundation (LLM):** Briefly explain this is just the raw intelligence (Claude 3.7, Gemini 1.5, GPT-4). It has no memory or hands yet.
2.  **The Context & Capabilities (Standards & Protocols):**
    * **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** Explain this as the "USB-C for AI"—a standard way for AIs to connect to data sources (Postgres, Slack, GitHub) without custom code.
    * **Context Files (`agents.md`):** Explain this as "README for Robots." It tells the AI *about* the project (rules, stack, conventions) so it doesn't hallucinate. (Source: agents.md).
    * **Skill Definitions (`skill.md`):** Explain this as "Training Modules." It tells the AI *how* to perform specific tasks (e.g., "How to run a migration"). (Source: agentskills.io).
    * *Key distinction:* `agents.md` is project context; `skill.md` is reusable capability.
3.  **The Worker (The Agent):**
    * Explain the "Agentic Loop": It doesn't just talk; it **Plans**, uses **Tools** (CLI, File edit), and **Debugs** its own mistakes.
    * Mention tools like **Cline** (formerly Roo Code) or **Windsurf** as examples of agents that live in your editor.
4.  **The Workspace (The Orchestrator):**
    * Explain that as agents get better, we stop just "chatting" and start "managing" them.
    * **Orchestrators:** Tools like **VibeKanban** (visualize agents working in parallel on a board) or **OpenDevin/AllHands**.
    * **The concept:** You assign a ticket to an agent, it creates a git worktree, tries to fix it, and requests review. You are the manager; the AI is the junior dev.

**Part 2: The Modes (The "How")**
Explain the different ways a dev interacts with these layers (referencing tools like Cursor/Windsurf/Cline):
1.  **Ask/Chat Mode:** "What does this function do?" (Context lookup).
2.  **Plan/Architect Mode:** "Read all these files and propose a refactor strategy." (Reasoning without editing).
3.  **Agent/Edit Mode:** "Implement the plan, run the tests, and fix errors until green." (Autonomous loop).

**Part 3: The Takeaway**
* How a junior dev should start: Don't jump straight to orchestrating 10 agents. Start with `Ask`, then master `Agent` mode in IDE, then look at `Orchestrators`.

**Research Verification:**
* Verify the current state/definition of `agents.md` vs `skill.md` to ensure the distinction is accurate.
* Verify `VibeKanban`'s specific workflow (git worktree isolation) as a prime example of orchestration.
```

```markdown
2. Explanation of the Prompt Strategy
Here is why I designed the prompt this way, so you know what to expect:

The "Context vs. Capability" Distinction: I explicitly asked the model to research the difference between agents.md (Project Context) and skill.md (Reusable Skills). This is often confused, and clarifying it will make your post authoritative.

The "USB-C" Analogy for MCP: I included this specific analogy instruction because MCP can be abstract. Framing it as a standard connector helps the audience grasp it immediately.

VibeKanban as a Concept, not just a Tool: I framed VibeKanban specifically around its "Git Worktree" feature. This is the "technical nugget" that makes the post valuable to developers—it explains how parallel agents actually work without breaking your code.

The "Search Journey" Log: I added the Critical Instruction at the very top. This ensures Gemini "remembers" to track its own thinking process, which we need for your second blog post.

Next Step:
Once you run this prompt and get the blog post, paste the result (or the "Search Journey" section) back here. I will then help you format the Secondary Post about "How we wrote this using AI."
```

With the prompt I opened a new Gemini conversation with the Deep Research feature and paste it there. I wait for the result.

After a few minutes of work it returns [the report](https://gemini.google.com/share/0a834d55074c) and I just asked to export it in markdown format to be able to use it in the blog post.


Just for reference, it used 24 sources to generate the report

The output was good, but too long for a blog post, and some references were outdated (it mentioned Gemini 1.5, but we are in Gemini 3 Pro), so I went back to the initial convesation, and asked to summarize it and update the references.

Note I didn't paste the repost, I just mentioned and it get it from other conversation.

```markdown
the report generated is too long and seems partially outdated, talkss about gemini1.5 and now we have gemini 3, same with claude and openai model, i can no trust in a report not updated
```

And finally it gave me this awnser:

```markdown
Here is the comprehensive, ready-to-publish blog post. It is structured to be clear, actionable, and uses the latest terminology for 2026.

Following that, I have included the "Meta-Post" detailing exactly how we built this.
```
(and the blog post content but I will not reproduce it here as you already have it in the :astro-ref[final post]{path="blog/2026/2026-02-15-ai-stack"})


And as last step I asked it to generate a cover image:

```markdown
ok, i need to generate the cover for the posts, write a prompt based in previous request, and generate it
```

And that's all, I have the blog post and the cover image ready to be published.

## Conclusion

Even if I don't want to read AI generated posts, I wanted to experiment with the process of creating one. I know this process can be fully automated using agents in a loop of generation, corrections, SEO improvements, image generation, etc. but I wanted keep it simple.

The result is a readable post, something probably I will never write in the same way, and that is what makes the difference. I think the content creation value in general is trending to 0, and the results is good, but this make more valuable the "hand-made" content as has behind it the writter life-expecience, the personal touch, hisd opinions.
