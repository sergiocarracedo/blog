Anyone who knows me well knows that I NOT am a big fan of Apple products and their philosophy, most people say they are amazing but I can not share that opinion. But this post is not about that. Let me explain why I want to use a Mac like a "normal" pc.


I'm working as a software developer, in remote mode, and I have a personal desktop computer at home I use to develop my projects, play games, and do everything I need. I had been using Linux (Ubuntu) for 20 years, and I like it because I can customize it as I want, I can use free software, and I feel in control of my computer.

2 years ago, I started a new position at a new company, and they provided me with a MacBook Pro as my work computer. I was something I don'like it but, I have no choice (only not accept it or not work there).

My first thought was ok, this could be a problem I a found OSX is much better than I expected, and I could not work in the same way in my personal computer.
But my experience with MacOS was not good, I found some UX decisions really annoying, and I missed some features I used in Linux, like the window titling and anchoring, the way to see all my open windows, just clicking in the app icon in the dock, words apart is the maximize button behavior, that I still not understaning. Also the command and control keys swapped places, and many other small things that made my experience not good.

I use the MacBook as a desktop computer, always closed, and connected to 2 external monitors, keyboard,mouse, and other usb devices using a KVM switch, so I can change from my personal computer to the work computer easily.

I wanted to minimize as much as possible the friction changing my work computer to my personal computer, so I started to customize my MacOS to be more like a "normal" pc, and this is what I did:


- **Disable touchID**: as I use the MacBook closed. [How to disable touchID](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-disable-the-TouchID-on-my-MacBook-Pro)

- **Make Fn keys permanent behavior**: As you know the fn keys have 2 behaviors, the special behavior (volume, brightness, etc) and the normal behavior (F1,F2,F3...). I want the normal behavior all the time. [How to do it]( 
https://support.apple.com/en-us/102439)

- **Disable "reactions"**: I really hate this thing poping up in any meet [How to disable it] https://it.cornell.edu/zoom/apple-video-effects

- **Dock on left and not hidden**: I'm very used to have the dock on the left side and always visible. The solucion is not perfect for me as the dock is centered and the app icons position changes impeding to use muscular memory, but is something. [How to do it](https://support.apple.com/en-bn/guide/mac-help/mchlp1119/mac)

- **Invert mouse scroll**: I prefer the normal scroll behavior in the mouse wheen, not the "natural" one. I'm not understaning why is not possible to define a different behavior for mouse and touchpad [How to do it](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204530)


## Accesibility

For me A person with a far to be perfect vision I need to increase the interface size and contrast to be able to read and find elements in the screen easily.

I found OSX accesibility options very bad, as for example I can not find a way to scale the interface, So I have to increase the text size but this doesn't apply to most of the interface elements like buttons.

- **Disable glass transparency**: For me A person with a far to be perfect vision, GlassUI is terrible and makes hard to read or find elements, I prefer a more solid look. [How to do it](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/256137197?sortBy=rank)

- **Disable UI animations**: This is just personal, I dont like them: [How to do it](https://support.apple.com/en-ph/guide/mac-help/mchlc03f57a1/mac)


## Keyboard

I explored many options to customize the keyboard behavior and different programs, but as my keyboard is a VIA/QMK compatible keyboard, With multiple layers and macros, 

The frist thing i did is to use one layout for MacOS remaping the necessary keys to have a more "normal" pc layout, like swapping command and control keys, remaping the alt key to be the windows key, etc. And I have to keys to change between MacOS layout and normal pc layout.

- **Home end keys**: I understand the way they work in MacOS (end go goes to end of the text, not the end of the current line), is just another way to do it, but I prefer the normal behavior (end goes to the end of the line). As the "regular" behavior is achievable using command+left/right arrow, I created a macro to do that when I press home or end keys.

- For some remaps I used Karabiner-Elements, that is a powerful keyboard remapper for MacOS. [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/), for example for the alt-tab behavior.

- **Disable input as mobile**: For me this autocomplete behavior like in the mobile phones is very annoying as impides to hold and repeat  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3646726?sortBy=best 


## Apps 
- I replaced spotlight for [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) and remap the activation key "Win+space" as it is not possible to just use "Win" key alone.

- [Rectangle app](https://rectangleapp.com/): to manage windows with keyboard shortcuts, and anchoring windows to screen sides and corners.

- [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/): for screenshots, as the default MacOS screenshot tool is very limited. I like to do annotations in the screenshots I take.


## Terminal
I deciced to use iterm2 as terminal emulator. The terminal (any) is challenging as after do the keyboard swap between Cmd and Ctrl, the terminal does it too, having the original behavior of Ctrl key in the Cmd key, and that is not what I want.

- Remaping all the escape sequences to have the normal behavior of Ctrl key in the Ctrl key, not in the Cmd key. I created a custom keymap in iterm2 to do that.

This is my configuration export:
