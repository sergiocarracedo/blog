I agree with all the contents of the posts, but I want to add some comments or ideas from the engineer&amp;rsquo;s point of view (it&amp;rsquo;s more about the point of view of a non-manager person).
It&amp;rsquo;s obvious not all people have the same personality, priorities, and communication skills, and the comments I will write in the next lines don&amp;rsquo;t apply to all people.</description></item></channel></rss>
