That was a website that needs to use a few images as building blocks, the typical section separator with a shape different to a simple line, in this case, the section&amp;rsquo;s separator had 2 colors and a shadow.
I decided to use SVG images for several reasons, for example the images had to adapt to different screen widths, and the images were simple (more complex than a line but simple, They were similar to 2 waves with 2 colors).</description></item></channel></rss>
