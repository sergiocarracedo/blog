&lt;p>I want to use this last post in the series to discuss col-related features, such as col sorting, hidden cols, excluded cols, fixed cols, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="user-defined-cols-vs-internal-cols">User-defined cols vs internal cols&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s important to know that one thing is the cols defined by the user, those are data cols and are defined via the cols definition property, and another thing is the cols in general, which include the user cols, but also cols are defined by other props or features of the table (internal cols), for example the col that renders the checkboxes in the case of a selectable table, the col, that shows an arrow to expand the col, the col that renders the action buttons, etc.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Query builder to filter data in TypeScript</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/query-builder-filter-data/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/query-builder-filter-data/</guid><description>&lt;p>I wrote posts (&lt;a href="https://sergiocarracedo.es/creating-a-table-component-i/">1&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://sergiocarracedo.es/creating-a-table-component-ii/">2&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://sergiocarracedo.es/creating-a-table-component-iii/">3&lt;/a>) about my learnings creating table components, and this post can be the third part as I made a query builder for that component, but it can be used in other uses cases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A query builder provides a convenient and (usually) simple interface for creating and executing queries (filtering) on a data set.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the &lt;a href="https://sergiocarracedo.es/creating-a-table-component-i/">first chapter&lt;/a> I talked about the data and cols definition. How to manipulate the data, transform it, and format it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This second chapter will focus on the pagination, sorting, and filtering features and the row selection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those features can be or cannot be the responsibility of the table, maybe you can delegate them in your code, and in some true way, but I like to provide a homogeneous and complete developer experience minimizing the repetitive tasks and putting them all together where they are needed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lessons I learned creating a table component (part I)</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/creating-a-table-component-i/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/creating-a-table-component-i/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>I love creating UI components because they are the fundamental bricks supporting a UI application. When the components are good enough, both User and Developer experience increases, making applications consistent, easy to implement, and easy to scale.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the UI application shows data in lists, sooner or later, you will need a table. Tables are UI components that can become very complex depending on their features. The goal of this blog post is not to tell you how to program features but to help you understand some typical needs and features tables should implement to give you useful ideas for your custom UI table component&amp;rsquo;s implementation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>UI components library (Chapter II): Components anatomy and interfaces</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/ui-components-library-ii-anatomy-interfaces/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/ui-components-library-ii-anatomy-interfaces/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>This is the first post of a series about why and how to create a UI components library. I&amp;rsquo;m going to focus on the code examples in Vue.js, but the concepts are valid for any other framework like React, Angular, LitElements, etc.
In this first post I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about the component of why you should (or should not) create a UI components library, but first let&amp;rsquo;s define what is a UI components library.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CSS variables scoping to create and theme flexible ui components</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/css-variables-scoping/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/css-variables-scoping/</guid><description>&lt;p>The real name of the &lt;em>CSS variables&lt;/em> is &lt;strong>CSS Custom Properties&lt;/strong> is a draft standard (yes when I wrote these lines is on &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/history/css-variables-1">Candidate Recommendation Snapshot&lt;/a>), but is widely supported by modern browsers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>CSS variables allow us, like another kind of variable in another programming language to store a value we can reuse across our document.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, if we define a CSS variable for the primary color doing: &lt;code>--primary-color: #f00;&lt;/code>, then we can use it in any component like:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to create a table with a fixed header</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/how-to-create-a-table-with-a-fixed-header/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/how-to-create-a-table-with-a-fixed-header/</guid><description>&lt;p>Tables in HTML are one of the older things in the standard, even before CSS we had HTML tables.

&lt;p>Over time the standard improves the table styling covering most of the use cases you can consider.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, there is a use case it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to get with the table attributes or style properties, I&amp;rsquo;m talking about creating a table with a fixed/sticky header (or footer).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Custom SVG icon set management with Vue</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/custom-svg-icon-set-management-with-vue/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/custom-svg-icon-set-management-with-vue/</guid><description>&lt;p>Manage an icon set can seem a simple task but can be tricky.&lt;/p>
