&lt;p>A few weeks ago I was developing a website using &lt;a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">NuxtJs&lt;/a> (which is not important for the problem but the is the context &amp;#x1f609; ). That was a website that needs to use a few images as building blocks, the typical section separator with a shape different to a simple line, in this case, the section&amp;rsquo;s separator had 2 colors and a shadow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided to use SVG images for several reasons, for example the images had to adapt to different screen widths, and the images were simple (more complex than a line but simple, They were similar to 2 waves with 2 colors). The SVG files are very useful in these use case, because the file size is small, and you can scale them infinitely without lost definition.&lt;br>
One important thing in this issue as we&amp;rsquo;ll see later is that this image had a shadow.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
