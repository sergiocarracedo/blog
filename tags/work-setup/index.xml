obviously, working remotely we have, let&amp;rsquo;s say, more than we would like, and is not always easy to know when the other
is in a meeting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided to find a solution to make it visible when someone is in a meeting simply, only with a sight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The solution: Put a light sign on the working room&amp;rsquo;s wall and turn it on when I am in a meet and off when I am not,
simple. :)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
