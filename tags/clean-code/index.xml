It can impact in the bundle generation or cause issues (for example in HMR) and you should avoid them because they are a symptom of an incorrect architecture or code organization and is a big code smell.
What are circular dependencies Circular dependencies occur when a package (A) depends on another package (B) and B also depends on A.</description></item><item><title>A real case: why hexagonal architecture, decoupling, and Dependency injection can be very useful in the frontend</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/hexagonal-architecture-frontend/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/hexagonal-architecture-frontend/</guid><description>Hexagonal architecture is a software design pattern based on the separation of responsibilities. The goal is to decouple the business logic (domain) and the application from other external interfaces.
Simplifying in hexagonal architecture we communicate the core of the app (domain + application) with the external elements using ports and adapters. A port lives in the core, it is the interface any external code must use to interact with the core (or the core with the external code), the adapter is the external piece of code that follows the port interface and execute the tasks, get the data, etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
