How to manipulate the data, transform it, and format it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This second chapter will focus on the pagination, sorting, and filtering features and the row selection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those features can be or cannot be the responsibility of the table, maybe you can delegate them in your code, and in some true way, but I like to provide a homogeneous and complete developer experience minimizing the repetitive tasks and putting them all together where they are needed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lessons I learned creating a table component (part I)</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/creating-a-table-component-i/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/creating-a-table-component-i/</guid><description>&lt;p>I love creating UI components because they are the fundamental bricks supporting a UI application. When the components are good enough, both User and Developer experience increases, making applications consistent, easy to implement, and easy to scale.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the UI application shows data in lists, sooner or later, you will need a table. Tables are UI components that can become very complex depending on their features. The goal of this blog post is not to tell you how to program features but to help you understand some typical needs and features tables should implement to give you useful ideas for your custom UI table component&amp;rsquo;s implementation.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
