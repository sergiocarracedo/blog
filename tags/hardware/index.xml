My very beginning thoughts were: &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t need this, I don&amp;rsquo;t know a real use case for that&amp;rdquo;. But I decided to keep it and try to use it for something.

They asked me which laptop I would like to use to work, most people would answer: MacBook Pro or something like that, but I don&amp;rsquo;t like Apple (sorry, those are my likes, maybe you have different ones), and I prefer Linux as my OS.
My first choice was a Dell XPS 15 with 16GB of RAM, but after several delays in delivery, my company and I were tired of waiting and we decided to order another laptop.</description></item></channel></rss>
