Maybe is time to remove them</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/no-more-js-semicolons/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/no-more-js-semicolons/</guid><description>I have been using standardjs (and standardts) for 5 years as lint ruleset in my projects, and I am very happy with that. I tried before Google config lint and eslint-config-airbnb and one of the main differences I found between those rulesets is relative to semicolons; Google and Airbnb require the use of semicolons at the of the lines, but standardjs don&amp;rsquo;t.
I worked a long time ago with PHP that requires them, but I adapted very fast to not use them in JavaScript and Go.</description></item></channel></rss>
