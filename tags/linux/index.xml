My very beginning thoughts were: &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t need this, I don&amp;rsquo;t know a real use case for that&amp;rdquo;. But I decided to keep it and try to use it for something.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-is-a-_stream-deck_">What is a &lt;em>Stream Deck&lt;/em>?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>Stream Deck&lt;/em> is a device with 15 buttons (in my case), each button has a small screen that can show an icon or a text. The device is connected to your computer via USB and it has software that allows you to configure each button and the action to do when you press it. I think it&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;stream&amp;rdquo; because one of the typical use cases is to change the &lt;a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS&lt;/a> scenes when you are streaming, but in general terms, you can control anything you want. You can think on it as a macro keyboard with customizable buttons, both action and key visualization.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
