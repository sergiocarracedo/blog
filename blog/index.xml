CSS variables allow us, like another kind of variable in another programming language to store a value we can reuse across our document.
For example, if we define a CSS variable for the primary color doing: --primary-color: #f00;, then we can use it in any component like:</description></item><item><title>Typescript enums, const enums and readonly maps</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/typescript-enums/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/typescript-enums/</guid><description>Enum basics Enums is one of the nice things Typescript bring to the Javascript development&amp;rsquo;s environment. Enums allows you to define a set of named values (constants), generally with a semantic meaning.
One of the advantages over the regular constants is the grouping, making easy to know the different values you can use in certain place (and limiting the possible values to use)
In Typescript an enum has this shape:</description></item><item><title>2022 in a Nutshell</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2022-in-a%20nutshell/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2022-in-a%20nutshell/</guid><description>2022 is over, for me, it was a very intense year, with a lot of challenges, changes, laughs and memorable moments.

With time the web applications became more complex with bigger requirements. New technologies, frameworks, and paradigms bounce into the development and pushed developers to specialize in some areas arising new roles from this specialization.
Nowadays, the equivalent typical roles for a web application that cover the exposed tasks/skills and the typical requirements are: Designer, Frontend developer, Backend developer, Platform engineer, and, in a data-oriented company: Data engineer, Data scientist, etc.</description></item><item><title>Typescript typing challenges and type utilities</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/typescript-typing-challenges-and-type-utilities/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/typescript-typing-challenges-and-type-utilities/</guid><description>Recently I was looking for more knowledge about Typescript typing, how to create more advanced and better types, and I can say that it&amp;rsquo;s a big deal, there are a lot of things you can do and, you never imagined before.

Type Narrowing is a technique that allows Typescript compiler to reduce the types of a value evaluating guard clauses in compilation time.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see a simple example, imagine we have a function to uppercase a value that can be number, string, or just null, into the function we need to handle the different cases, but at the same time Typescript can understand the types and reduce value type to the correct type in each code&amp;rsquo;s branch.</description></item><item><title>Giving (Negative) Feedback From Engineers to Managers</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/negative-feedback-from-engineers-to-managers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/negative-feedback-from-engineers-to-managers/</guid><description>A couple of weeks ago my friend Miguel Garcia Lorenzo releases this quite interesting post about the continuous feedback from the engineering managers.

Por eso, cuando hablamos de arquitecturas limpias, clean code, desacomparte del framework, etc. en muchos casos nos suenan a que nuestro producto va a ser mejor solo por el hecho de aplicarlas.
Pero no siempre es así, hay fases en la que la simplicidad del código prima sobre su “belleza”, donde la rapidez en el delivery prima sobre la abstracción, pero lo importante es que seamos conscientes antes o despues necesitaremos arquitecturas limpias para seguir creciendo y escalando.</description></item><item><title>Generics in Golang 1.18</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/generics-in-golang-1.18/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/generics-in-golang-1.18/</guid><description>At the moment of writing this post Go 1.18 wasn&amp;rsquo;t released (the latest version for 1.18 is the Release Candidate 1), but we can still play using the playground (enabling the dev branch) or installing the RC

The most common way to do it is to have a replica of our production infrastructure. Actually, it&amp;rsquo;s relatively easy to achieve using containers, for example, docker containers.
We can set up and run a container for every service we need to replicate, we can orchestrate it with docker-compose and create some makefiles or just a simple script to prepare the infrastructure and run the integration tests.</description></item><item><title>Vue Composition API: How to split and reuse code</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/vue-composition-api-how-to-split-and-reuse-code/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/vue-composition-api-how-to-split-and-reuse-code/</guid><description>The Vue Composition API arrived at us in Nov 2018, 2 years ago, as a preview and become with some controversial, because people believed composition API would replace the traditional Object API, but would not.

Imagine you have a UI component to render a TO-DO list with a button to create a TO-DO item through a form. This component is self-encapsulated, you only need to put the component in your app, and the component itself renders the list, the button, the form, do the request to API, etc.</description></item><item><title>How to create a table with a fixed header</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/how-to-create-a-table-with-a-fixed-header/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/how-to-create-a-table-with-a-fixed-header/</guid><description>Tables in HTML are one of the older things in the standard, even before CSS we had HTML tables.

Over time the standard improves the table styling covering most of the use cases you can consider.
But, there is a use case it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to get with the table attributes or style properties, I&amp;rsquo;m talking about creating a table with a fixed/sticky header (or footer).</description></item><item><title>Soy casi un boomer y consumo Twitch: Mis streams favoritos</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/mis-streams-favoritos-de-twitch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/mis-streams-favoritos-de-twitch/</guid><description>Disclaimer: Este es mi primer post en castellano en bastante tiempo, el motivo es el contenido del que voy a hablar está mayoritariamente en castellano y sería un poco raro hacerlo en inglés

Find a beautiful and related picture for the header and home page.</description></item><item><title>Improving your Vue (and JS) coding quality and workflow</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2020/06/21/Improving-your-JS-workflow/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jun 2020 12:47:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2020/06/21/Improving-your-JS-workflow/</guid><description>To start coding Javascript (and other languages), you almost need nothing, just a simple, text editor. That is good to start coding when you are learning the language, just code without distractions.
But when you develop bigger projects or/and with others, some problems appears: code organization, coding style, and other. That is because all languages have at a least clean code style guide.
Things like use semi-colon or not at the end of the line, the number of spaces indenting code, etc.</description></item><item><title>My favorite YouTube Channels 2020</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2020/06/02/my-favourite-youtube-channels-2020/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2020/06/02/my-favourite-youtube-channels-2020/</guid><description>In 2018, I did a list of my favourite YouTube Channels (Spanish), almost 2 years pass after this post and on this time I start to watch new channels and remove or watch less other channels.

First approximation We could create a SVG document to draw our donut. SVG allow us to represent graphical elements, for example, cicles, rectangles, polygons, etc&amp;hellip; using XML (and therefore accesing to the elements via DOM). SVG is vertorial and is perfect for responsive.
Figure 1 represent that kind of chart, if the value is 100% the donut is perfect, if is 50% donut is a half donut, and 0% means no donut.</description></item><item><title>Javascript unary operators: Taking advantage using them</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2020/05/09/js-unary-operators-and-taking-advantage/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2020/05/09/js-unary-operators-and-taking-advantage/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s an operator? An operator is a symbol that define the operation to do between 1 o more operands.
We use a lot of operators: sum (+), subtraction (-), multiply (*), division (/), logic and (&amp;amp;&amp;amp;), negation (!),&amp;hellip;
What&amp;rsquo;s a unary operator? A unary operator is an operator that only needs one operand to work. For example
i++ In this example we have an operand (i) and an operator (++), we don&amp;rsquo;t need more to increment the i variable value.</description></item><item><title>Understanding Javascript's event loop: Macrotasks and microtasks</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2020/04/27/js-loop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2020/04/27/js-loop/</guid><description>Despite what it may seem, Javascript execution in a browser is synchronous. It is a similar thing as a multitask OS running in a mono-core processor, in that case multitasking is &amp;ldquo;fake&amp;rdquo;, because the processor can only execute one instruction at a time, but the OS controls the execution and distribute the processor time between each app, making it looks like multitasking.
In Javascript we have a similar approximation in a way to distribute the execution time.</description></item><item><title>Slimbook ProX 15: First Impressions</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2020/04/05/slimbook-prox15-first-impressions/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2020/04/05/slimbook-prox15-first-impressions/</guid><description>As you probably know, I started a new job this year, and my company provided me a laptop.

JS doesn’t store the object value in your variable or in your constant, instead, stores a pointer to the object value (the object reference).
Even when you pass an object to a function or method, you are passing this object by reference, not the value.
If you pass (or copy) an object by reference and then change any property, the ‘source’ object’s property also changes.</description></item><item><title>Vue Router lazy loading and chunking</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2019/12/29/vue-router-lazy-loading-and-chunking/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2019/12/29/vue-router-lazy-loading-and-chunking/</guid><description>When you start to create SPA (Single page application) you must bear in mind that SPA doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean Single JavaScript file.

Funciones de primera clase o de orden superior Son aquellas que pueden recibir como parámetros otra función, por ejemplo la función &amp;lsquo;array_map&amp;rsquo; de PHP, recibe dos argumentos, un callable y un array, devolviendo una matriz con el resultado de aplicar el callable (normalmente una función) a cada elemento de la matriz original.</description></item><item><title>PHP Reflection: Anotaciones, PHPDoc y mucho más</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2019/11/01/php-reflection/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2019/11/01/php-reflection/</guid><description>La reflexíón en PHP es algo que nunca he usado, y que posiblemente no usaré más allá de curiosear su funcionamiento como en este post (como otras muchas veces es posible que me trague estas palabras 😄), y creo que la mayoría de vosotros tampoco ha usado.

Pero los usuarios de linux tenemos una alternativa más simple pero igual de potente wget wget es un comando que nos permite descargar cualquier contenido en la red a nuestro equipo, normalmente se emplea para descargar ficheros sueltos: html, imágenes, vídeos, etc&amp;hellip; pero con los parámetros adecuados puede descargar un sitio web completo</description></item><item><title>Disconect.me: Navega de forma privada</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2012/04/10/disconectme-navega-de-forma-privada/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2012/04/10/disconectme-navega-de-forma-privada/</guid><description>Con la proliferación de los plugins &amp;lsquo;sociales&amp;rsquo;, que están cada día presentes en más paginas, la navegación privada comenzaba a ser una utopía. Por ejemplo, por el simple hecho de tener una sesión abierta (o no) en Facebook, cada vez que entramos en una web que dispone de un inocente botón &amp;ldquo;Me gusta&amp;rdquo;, podremos ser identificados.
Esto no quiere decir que se haga, pero la posibilidad esta ahí. La web que visitamos no sabe (o no tiene que saber quienes somos), pero el plugin social si que sabe quienes somos y que web estamos visitando, ya que tiene nuestra sesión en la red social y la página que pide mostrar el plugin.</description></item><item><title>Cookies en un IFRAME en Internet Explorer: p3p policy</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2012/02/22/cookies-en-un-iframe-en-internet-explorer-p3p-policy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2012/02/22/cookies-en-un-iframe-en-internet-explorer-p3p-policy/</guid><description>Si desarrollas una aplicación PHP web que trabaja dentro de un IFRAME lo más probable es que necesite usar una sesión y para almacenar el id de la sesión necesitarás una cookie (de esto se encarga el propio PHP) pero deberás tener en cuenta algunas consideraciones para evitarte problemas de funcionamiento en Internet Explorer 6+

var Faye = require(&amp;#39;./faye/faye-node.js&amp;#39;); var fayeServer = new Faye.NodeAdapter({&amp;amp;nbsp; mount: &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;#39;/&amp;#39;}); fayeServer.listen(8888); A este fichero lo llamaremos node.js, ahora desde bash lanzamos el servidor que acabamos de crear: $ node node.</description></item><item><title>Mejorando node.js: Faye</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2011/07/11/mejorando-nodejs-faye/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2011/07/11/mejorando-nodejs-faye/</guid><description>Como ya comentamos en una entrada anterior node.js es una herramienta muy potente, que nos permite crear servidores empleando javascript como lenguaje de programación en el servidor, pero puede ser costoso crear ciertas herramientas y protocolos desde 0.

En otras palabras, faye se encarga de gestionar los canales, los envios de mensajes y la recepción por parte de los subscriptores a esos canales.</description></item><item><title>3D sin plugins en tu navegador con javascript: three.js</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2011/06/27/3d-sin-plugins-en-tu-navegador-con-javascript-threejs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2011/06/27/3d-sin-plugins-en-tu-navegador-con-javascript-threejs/</guid><description>Hasta hace muy poco necesitábamos plugins, para realizar tareas que ahora nos parecen triviales, reproducir sonido, ver videos, hasta la más simple de las animación de un botón.

Lo más básico que podemos realizar con node.js es un servidor web (HTTP).
var http = require(&amp;#39;http&amp;#39;); http.createServer(function (req, res) { res.writeHead(200, {&amp;#39;Content-Type&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;text/plain&amp;#39;}); res.end(&amp;#39;Hello World\n&amp;#39;); }).listen(8124, &amp;#34;127.0.0.1&amp;#34;); Con estas pocas lineas tenemos un servidor web escuchando el puerto 8124 funcionando en nuestro equipo y respondiendonos siempre &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo;</description></item><item><title>Servidor de Máquinas virtuales remotas con Virtualbox</title><link>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2010/10/19/servidor-de-maquinas-virtuales-remotas-con-virtualbox/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergiocarracedo.es/2010/10/19/servidor-de-maquinas-virtuales-remotas-con-virtualbox/</guid><description>Para un desarrollador de web, es muy importante tener un entorno de desarrollo y de prueba completamente optimizado.

Una buena manera de hacerlo es cambiar alternativamente el título de la página por un aviso, de la misma forma que hace facebook cuando recibimos una notificación de chat; el título de la página cambia 3 o 4 veces entre &amp;ldquo;Facebook&amp;hellip;.</description></item></channel></rss>
