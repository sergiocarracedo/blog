As you possibly know I co coordinate a local community ([PHPVigo](https://phpvigo.com)) and participate in others ([VigoTech Alliance](https://vigotech.org)). So I have been creating a lot of tools to help communities to manage their events, steams, websites, etc. Making cordinators life a little bit easy, for example

### OBS Stream Widget
<div class="left-33">
    {% youtube lmA2QX8OX70 %}
</div>
This project still in development, that will be a set of tools to add widgets to OBS Steams. For example, you can display the chat, a countdown before the stream starts, sponsors logos. The goal is provide a simple way to create and configure the widgets.

### Talks Screencast Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome Extension that allow the communities to make and screen cast, with the speaker camera, and a layout displaying the talk title, etc mixing all elements in one video stream saved to file.

### User group OBS Background
An electron app, to create a layout for OBS. This project is a legacy version of previous one
You can prepare the talks before the day of the meetup, preparing talks titles, speakers names, etc and change in one second during the stream

### VigoTech Webpage and Metagroup import tools
The point of this project is not the web, is the data structure and the automation process.

For communities' coordinators, main the information, meetups, dates, comunication is a hard task, so we created a JSON Schema to store all the communities data: name, logo, web, etc, and events data sources: Meetup, Evenbrite, custom JSON and then the website is built getting all the information from sources
