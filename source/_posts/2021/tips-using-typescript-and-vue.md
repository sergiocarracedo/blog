Typescript is great "language", makes possible creating more maintainable and understandable software, but requires extra effort to type the variables, the functions arguments, etc...

Vue 2.x, and even more Vue 3 provide a great typescript integration, providing the necessary types to use your app, but not always are trivial, and you need to know tye types you must use in every case.

I want to share with all of you the lessons I learnt in my experience using Vue and TS, the typical questions, and "problems" I found in the way.

## Vuex
** Write about how to type store, getters, actions, etc... **

## Composition API
  Typing setup: props, etc
  
## Typing properties

## Add extra entries to Vue object
