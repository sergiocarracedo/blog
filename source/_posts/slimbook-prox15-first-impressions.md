As probably you know, I started a new job this year, and my company provided me a laptop. They asked me what laptop I would like to use to work, most people would answer: MacBook Pro or something like that, but I don't like Apple (sorry, those are my likes, maybe you have different ones), and I prefer Linux as my OS.

My first choice was a Dell XPS 15 with 16GB of RAM, but after several delays in delivery, my company and me were tired of waiting, we decided to order another laptop.

I was mulling over which model to choose, and I asked my friend Félix, who wrote a post about [what laptop you can buy to work as a developer](https://felixgomez.eu/2019/12/01/que-ordenador-me-compro-para-desarrollar-ii/) <small>(Spanish)</small> and he told me: "[Slimbook PROX](https://slimbook.es/prox)" a 13.3" powerful laptop made by a Spanish company specialized in Linux laptops.

It was a great option, but most time I usually work on a desktop computer and I prefer a laptop with larger screen.

I finally chose the 15" version of that laptop: [the PROX15](https://slimbook.es/prox15). But not only change the screen size, there are more differences from PROX: PROX15 is a high performance oriented laptop. 

I configure my order with 32GB of RAM, 512GB NVMe SSD and an Intel Dual Band 9560AC Wifi Card.

One thing I like of that company is you can deeply [configure your computer](https://slimbook.es/en/store/slimbook-pro-x-15/prox15-comprar): you can choose memory, 1 or 2 SSD storage (with RAID 0 or ! if you choose 2), WIFI Card, Keyboard layout, and OS. And component are not welded to motherboard, that means you can upgrade the computer in the future. 

But let's get down to business

After 3-4 week using the laptop (non intensive use) these are my thougths


# Things a love
### Size
The size is perfect for me. Big screen in a size contained case. Screen borders are very narrow (about 5mm) so laptop size is similar to 14"

### Powerful CPU and GPU
CPU it's a 9th generation [Intel i7-9750](https://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/products/processors/core/i7-processors/i7-9750h.html) H series, it's a mobility oriented process, but focused in performance. 2.60GHz, 6 cores, (12 threads). 
Processor has an integrated Intel UHD Graphics 630, but has a dedicated NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1650 with 4GB of dedicated RAM. If your system supports PRIME you be able to choose what graphics card use. Intel to save battery or NVIDIA for performance.

I benchmarked both graphics card (Intel and Nvidia) and my desktop computer (Nvidia GTX 950) using [Unigine Valley Benchmark](https://benchmark.unigine.com/valley) and that was the results.

It's amazing! 

 

### Weight and case materials
<div class="mb-3 right-50">
{% img "photoswipe" /images/slimbookprox15/keyboard.jpg %}
</div>
It's a very light laptop considering its size, only 1.5Kg. Case is made in alloy magnesium and aluminium very pleasant to the touch, at first view it could looks plastic, but not the touch it's very different, it's not cold like only aluminium.  


### Connections
It has a lot of them: HMDI (full size), USB 2.1, USB 3.0, USB-C, RJ45, Jack 3.5mm, MicroSD.
Using a dock station you could connect laptop to 3 external screens.  

### Keyboard
I love keyboard layout, keys are little bit bigger than my old laptop ([Asus ZenBook UX330UA](https://www.asus.com/es/Laptops/ASUS-ZenBook-UX330UA/)) keyboard, directions keys are complete and have: Start, End, PageStart, PageEnd keys


### Upgradable
Components: Storage (2xM2 slots) and memory banks are upgradeable. Is a feature that I apreciate a lot. Maybe in the future, I will add other SSD. It's possible to do, and does not force you to choose a oversized compoments at gold price (cof, cof Apple) just in case.

### Price
That is work computer, and it was buyed buy my company. But the price was about 1500€ (VAT included). I think is a very low price considering the specifications.


# Other things

### Touchpad
I'm not a big fan of touchpad, I like mice, but I think the Slimbook's touchpad it's very good. More than enough for me.

### Battery
As I said before, and because quarantine, I didn't use the laptop intensively. Maker said up to 12h of life, but they are honest and talk about [5-8 with an office use](https://slimbook.es/en/prox15-en#preguntasfreq), obviously, playing games or using CPU and GPU intensive apps, batery duration will be short as using "normal" apps

### Refrigeration
Doing graphics benchmark I guess fans were at maximum speed, there are a little bit noise, but in acceptable levels bearing in mind GPU was at 80ºC at maximum performance. I only felt the temperature in a small zone in the keyboard.

# Things I don't like

### Keyboard backlight
<div class="mb-3 right-33">
  {% img "photoswipe" /images/slimbookprox15/keyboard_backlight.jpg %}
</div>
It is not very bright, even raising the level to maximum. 
The problem is keyboard is metalic gray, and for me, is hard to see keys' symbols. 
It's worse with backlight on, because the contrast between key color and symbol color it's very low. 
You can see it in the picture.

### Windows key
I know, it's a "standard" but I don't like it.

# Summary
In the future, after using it more time, I will write a more complete review, but at this moment I think I have a very good laptop, high quality materials, nice screen, powerful components which are upgradables, no problem installing linux. I'm very happy with it. 

I cannot forget good attention of Slimbook company. When I have any doubt about assembly proccess or something else, they answer me very fast in Twitter.
