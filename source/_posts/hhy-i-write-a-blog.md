I you are here (Welcome!) you are reading my personal blog, this is obvious :joy:, and I want to share with you why a write it.

Write a blog is some ways a hard task:
 
* You must find an interesting topic to write about it.
* Look for information related to the choosen topic
* Read a lot of references about it.
* Write your blog post
* Review it
* Correct it
* Find a beautiful and related picture for the header and home page.
* And finally publish it
* Well, also you could want to share on Twitter or Linked In too.

Ok, but why you to this "efford", in somehow I do those as selfish 


* To Learn
* To Practice english
* To Share knowledge
* Get in deep in a topic
* To keep information
