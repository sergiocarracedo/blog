If you are here (Welcome!) you are reading my blog, this is obvious :joy:, and I want to share with you why a write it.

Write a blog is some ways a hard task:
 
* You must find an interesting topic to write about it.
* Look for information related to the chosen topic
* Read a lot of references about it.
* Write your blog post
* Review it
* Correct it
* Find a beautiful and related picture for the header and home page.
* And finally publish it
* Well, also you could want to share on Twitter or Linked In too.

Ok, but why do you do this "effort"? In somehow I do this thinking of myself:


## To Learn
All this effort you do reading about the topic and looking references makes you learn a lot about the topic and about other things you didn't know previously. Well, is not the same write opinions or feelings (like this post) or write a technical article. 

## Going in deep on the topic
Very related to the previous one is go in deep in the topic. For example when you write about some technical topic you know a lot about, probably you could think that you don't need read anything, but is interesting to check your arguments and that forces you to go deep in the topic, more than you expect.


## To Practice English
When I created this webpage I started to write in Spanish because is my native language (the order one is Galician), but six months ago I joined an English speaking team, and I need to improve my English.

One way to do that is to write my blog articles in English to practice it. (I know I make a lot of mistakes, but this is part of the way to improve :sweat:)

## To Share knowledge
I like to learn, and one source of (technical) knowledge is to read other people's blogs, and I want to return a little of what I have received.

## As own reference
This might sound stupid, but I came back to my old blog post to find information about some things. Things I don't do for a long time and I forget how I resolved it, but I know that I wrote a post about that. So I just need to visit my blog and find the article.


These are my motivations. What are yours?
