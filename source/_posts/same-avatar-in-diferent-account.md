Probably you have several internet services accounts, and some in the same service, for example two _gmail_ accounts, one for work and a personal, or {% post_link instagram-rbg 'multiple Instagram accounts as me' %}

I like to use same picture as avatar in every account, but the problem is that it is difficult to differentiate.

I'm using a simple tip to differentiate them, add a color band at picture bottom, the point is use same color for every single account or role, for example you could use black for work, and green for personal.

So when you are logged and see the avatar, you can know which account are you logged in.

Next picture shows my avatars in 2015:

Be sure that the color band has height enough when the avatar is a circle.

Using that tip is easier to differentiate the account your are using, in the example below, in _gmail_

If you are using OAuth, for example "Login with Google" button, to login in to third party services, the avatar is the same as the source account and this tip still working.
