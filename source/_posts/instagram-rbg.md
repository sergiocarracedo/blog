This is my first 2020 post and the first one in English. I joined a team whose main language is English and i need to improve it :disappointed:

I will start writing about non-technical topics, in this case about my 3 public Instagram accounts.

### Red

About 3 years ago, in 2016, I decided to create an Instagram account only for red things pictures because I thought in the global visual effect in the account profile page. This is the effect I am talking about:

{% img "photoswipe mb-0" /images/instagram/sergiocarracedo-red.png %}
&nbsp;

This is that account https://www.instagram.com/sergiocarracedo.red/

### Green

In August of this year I created another account with same concept, but for green things: https://www.instagram.com/sergiocarracedogreen/

### Blue

And a few days later, I completed the RGB project creating the blue one: https://www.instagram.com/sergiocarracedo.blue/

In the beginning I thought that taking pictures based on a single color would be easy but I was wrong. Taking pictures is complicated, maybe the red are the easiest, and blue ones the hardest, always with the constraint of not repeating topic.

There are a lot of blue ones if you think of the sea and the skies, but all those pictures would be similar.

I you like this idea (different Instagram account based in color), please follow them:

Red: https://www.instagram.com/sergiocarracedo.red/
Green: https://www.instagram.com/sergiocarracedogreen/
Blue: https://www.instagram.com/sergiocarracedo.blue/
