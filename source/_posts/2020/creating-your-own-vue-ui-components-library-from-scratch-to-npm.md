Past September 29th I did a talk about how to create your own Vue UI components.

I explained some tips about how to organize the components' code, talked in deep about how to set the values in `package.json` and their meaning. And how to publish on NPM and then how to use them in another project.

The talk was in Spanish, but slides are in English.
