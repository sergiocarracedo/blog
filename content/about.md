I discovered computers when I was child in a moment the home computers started to be more common. My first computer was
an [Amstrad CPC 464](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC) with a green-screen, in that moment I understood and
wanted to learn more about computers.

As child I started to program in BASIC, then QBASIC and later Turbo Pascal (I keep an example rescued from an old floppy
disk: https://bitbucket.org/sergiocarracedo/liga-fantastica-marca/src/master/)
