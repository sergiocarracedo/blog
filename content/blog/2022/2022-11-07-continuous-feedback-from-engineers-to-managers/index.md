A couple of weeks ago my friend Miguel Garcia Lorenzo releases this quite interesting post [about the continuous feedback from the engineering managers](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/engineering-manager-continuous-feedback-miguel-garcia-lorenzo).

I agree with all the contents of the posts, but I want to add some comments of ideas from the engineer point of view (it's more about the point of view of the a non-manager person).

It's obvious not all the people have the same personality, priorities and communication skills, and the comments I will write in the next lines don't apply to all people.

As it was written in the mentioned post, the feedback is quite important in the organizations, it's a tool to improve and to know in detail the current situation.

As Miguel says in his post, the feedback has to be constructive, and I believe that should be in both ways, the engineer can complains about something (that is feedback too) but it should be constructive. 

But, what about of **the feedback of the feedback**, **what is the reaction** of the manager or company **to a negative feedback**

## The reaction of the feedback

For me, this is the key thing of the feedback: what does it happen when the message is not positive?

By default, the most of us will not give negative feedback without know the response or reaction, this is a natural behavior, just a way to protect our selves. 

I want to introduce the concept of _level of negativity_, that is something every person have its own levels, and depends on how "the negative thing to tell" affects the person or the project, but basically to the person. If the negative feedback affects you less, I think is less likely you give the feedback to you managers. If affects you more, probably you will expose it.

It's important to say that not all the negative feedback is a complain, negative feedback can also be, for example, a delay in the delivery, that you are not sleeping well, etc. Even ask salary review can be something "negative" (at least for me) from the engineer point of view (and it shouldn't) 

The main question is how the manager will handle this feedback: As Miguel mentioned the **honesty is key**, maybe your feedback is the feedback you should give, but the company or the manager cannot do anything about it or is just the expected from the company, the manager must be honest and tell you, the worse thing the manager can to it's just get your feedback and ignore it.


We are agree, the feedback is necessary, but I think is a responsibility of the managers to create the correct environment to make easy to give negative feedback.

## The environment for feedback
* **Continuous**: to have the possibility of give feedback should be a normal, and recurrent in the time thing. If engineer needs to force a meeting to say something negative, the possibilities of not do it are high. We can achieve that with regular all -hands, 1-on-1, informal talks drinking a coffee, etc.
  No one likes to says "we need to talk", thats is a bad way to start a feedback conversation.
* **Natural**: the feedback, positive and negative in general should be something natural, i think even the manager should ask for negative feedback, but doing it in a natural way, without force anyone to say something negative in that moment.
* **Honesty**: As I mentioned before, is key.
* **Consistent and reasoned**: The *perceived* response to the feedback should be the same or similar in all the cases, if the engineer asks for a salary review, and it's rejected, but a teammate do the same, and it's accepted, the first engineer need to know why the result it's different. Maybe some KPI are not good enough, the engineer should know it
* **No revenge**: Bad consequences of giving a negative feedback will do that person will not do more negative feedback, and provably the whole team.  

I strongly believe those points makes a better environment for negative (and positive) feedback, some of them seem trivial or very basic, but are not at all.

Obviously give a negative feedback shouldn't be a festival of bad words, say bad thing about teammates or complain without give a constructive message, we, the engineers, have our own responsibilities giving feedback

## The engineer feedback's responsibilities
* **Constructive**: The objective of giving (negative) feedback is to improve or change things, your feedback should be always constructive.
* **Respectful**: You can say the same without lose respect for anyone.
* **Concise**: You need to be clear explaining the key points of your feedback, mainly in the negative one
* **Honest**: Be honest is key as well here.
* **Open to hear**: feedback is not a monologue, you should be open to hear and to dialog.

In general, the negative (and positive) feedback should be assertive and honest

Giving feedback is team work, managers should create the correct environment and the engineers should be brave and be able to express "negative" things too.

All of us have responsibility in how we do the feedback, as engineer you can't think is just a manager responsibility to "extract" the feedback from you, and as a manager you can't think the engineer will give you feedback just because of the reasons.
