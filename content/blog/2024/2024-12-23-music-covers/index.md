A cover version is a new performance or recording by someone other than the original artist typically with another production style or genre. 

As is Xmas time, this is a cover of "Carol of the Bells" with metal style:

Long time ago, in the [Napster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster) epoch, I discovered the covers, specifically punk covers of pop songs. It was a revelation for me, and I started to search for more and more covers. With the time I discovered that there are a lot of covers, not only punk covers, but also metal, rock, and other genres covers of pop songs, and also covers of other songs.

Before Spotify, [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/gasman40) was my favourite way of listening music (now last.fm is just the scrobbler but time ago, it was a tag-based music player too). I discover more and more covers, and when the Spotify era started, I started to create playlists with my favourite covers.


Here are some of my favourite covers playlists, most of them are punk and metal covers of pop songs:

And this one is one of my latest discoveries, a playlist of LoFi-style covers of "famous songs" I use a lot to work:

For me covers world is a rabbit hole, you start with a song you like, and you end with a lot of new songs and artists you never heard before. There are even groups that only do covers, Our Last Night, Northern Kings, etc.

I hope you enjoy the playlists as much as I do.
