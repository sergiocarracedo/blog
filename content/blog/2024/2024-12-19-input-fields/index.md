 Reusability and consistency are two concepts I am "obsessed" with. Maybe is because I know the effort and pain of maintaining a UI component library without those concepts in mind. It's also about the developer experience, and the less time you spend on repetitive tasks, the more time you have to focus on the real problems and deliver value to your users. And from the user point of view, consistency is a key factor in the usability of an application.

## The problem

When you develop an UI components library, it's very common to have different components to allow user to introduce information in different ways: (I'm going to use [NextUI](https://nextui.org/) components as an example, but you can apply this concept to any UI library)
- Text fields
- Text areas
- Selects or Dropdowns
- Date pickers
- File fields
- Checkboxes
- Radio buttons
- ....


Lets focus on the fields that allow the user to introduce text or a value, like text fields, text areas, selects, date pickers, file fields etc.
